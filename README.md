## 🧑‍💼 About Me  
I'm a passionate software engineering student who loves coding and is always curious about the tech world. I enjoy diving into new technologies and building scalable, user-centered web applications. My focus is on creating impactful tech solutions that make a difference.

I work comfortably with modern frontend frameworks like React and backend environments such as Node.js. I also have experience with Java and Kotlin. Currently, I'm exploring full-stack development and actively building projects to grow my skills every day.
